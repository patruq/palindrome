About:

This is a one file program to be run via the command line.

It is a simple first project that follows only a few short steps:
1) Ask the user to enter a word.
2) That word is iterated backwards, the characters being stored in
   a new variable/string.
3) The user-entered word and the new backwards word are compared,
   and a message is logged to the screen over whether they match.
