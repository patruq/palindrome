// This Repository is a compilation of several 'drafts', stored as separate files. My hope is to demonstrate the evolution of my progress in creating a small program from start to finish.


About the Program:

This is a one file program to be run via the command line.

It is a simple first project that follows only a few short steps:
1) Ask the user to enter a word.
2) That word is iterated backwards, the characters being stored in
   a new variable/string.
3) The user-entered word and the new backwards word are compared,
   and a message is logged to the screen over whether they match.
4) After a word has been entered and evaluated, the program asks the 	user if they would like to continue; if yes, the program requests 	another word and continues as long as the user chooses.
